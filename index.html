    <p id="parag">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document. </p>
    <p>HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. Instead, with HTML, web users can create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. </p>
    <p>Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. </p>
    <p>Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. </p>
    <p>Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>
    <p>It’s also worth noting that HTML is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.</p>
    <p>This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to CSS and JavaScript. </p>
    <p>The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.</p>
    <p>HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.</p>
    <p>All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an attribute describes the characteristics of an element. </p>
    <p>Opening tag – used to state where an element starts to take effect. The tag is wrapped with opening and closing angle brackets. For example, use the start tag <p> to create a paragraph. </p>
    <p>Content – this is the output that other users see. </p>
    <p>Another attribute, the HTML class, is most important for development and programming. The class attribute adds style information that can work on different elements with the same class value. For example, we will use the same style for a heading and a paragraph
    <p>The style includes background color, text color, border, margin, and padding, under the class .important. To achieve the same style between and , add  after each start tag: </p>
    <p>This image tag has two attributes – an src attribute, the image path, and an alt attribute, the descriptive text. However, it does not have content nor an end tag. Lastly, every HTML document must start with a declaration to inform the web browser about the document type. With HTML5, the doctype HTML public declaration will be</p>
